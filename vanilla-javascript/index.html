     * Vanilla JavaScript is a term used to describe plain JavaScript without any additional libraries like jQuery or React.
     * We use Vanilla JavaScript to refer to the standard version of JavaScript that runs in the browser.
     *
     * 1. Add one more tool to your toolbox.
     * 2. Understand how the library we use works under the hood.
     * 3. Extend your library with plugins.
     * 4. TO mix and match libraries.
     * 5. Lightweight and fast.

     * 1. document: The entry point to the DOM. We can have multiple documents in a browser, but there is always one main document.

     * 3. One object per element in the document.

     * 1. In this document, each HTML tag has an associated object in the DOM. Each object has properties and methods associated with it.
     * 2. We can manipulate the properties of eaech object which will trigger updates in the browser, once we release the main thread.
     *
     * To work with DOM elements, I can either pick an element from the DOM, or inject an element into the DOM.
