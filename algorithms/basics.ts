 * Time complexity.
 * 1. Time complexity is the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input.
 * 2. It helps us make decisions about the efficiency of an algorithm.
 * 3. We always drop the constants and lower order terms.

 * Arrays:
 * 1. Arrays are contiguous blocks of memory of a fixed size.
 * 2. In traditional arrays, the size is fixed. int32[3] => This means that the array can hold 3 integers.

/**
 * Linear Search:
 * 1. Linear search is a simple search algorithm that searches for a target value within an array.
 * 2. It compares each element of the array to the target value until a match is found.
