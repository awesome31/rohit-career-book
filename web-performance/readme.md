# Web Performance

## The problem

1. Slow websites results in less conversion.
2. Slow websites increases the bounce rate.
3. Web performance is not optimised for mobile devices.

## Metrics

### Browser Centric Metrics

Browser centric metrics are not important today for Web Performance Optimisation.

1. Time to first Byte (TTB): Imagine that 0 is the time where the user either clicks on a link or refreshes the page. Time to forst byte refers to the time it takes for the first byte of response to come from the server.
2. First Paint: First paint refers to the first thing that is being rendered on the browser.
3. Page load: Page load essentially is an event that is fired after every file is downloaded, everything is painted, including iFrames. Even the content below the fold is considered a part of the page load. When the spinner on the top stops loading is when we consider that the page is loaded.

### User Centric metrics

Nowadays, we as developers should care about user centric metrics.

1. First Interactive: The first time where the main thread gets free.
2. Speed Index: Speed index is essentially calculates how much of the content loads over how much time it takes for the content to load. How much blank the user's see when the page is loading.
3. Time to Interactive: The first time we are able to interact.
4. LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)
5. Custom Metric: We can define metric for our own metric.
