# Concepts Learnt

1. By default the entry point of an android application is the MainActivity file. 

2. Layouts are defined using an xml file. There are primarily two types of views that exist in layout:
   1. View => These control the layout of a particular element. Classes like TextView or ButtonView extend from the View class.
   2. ViewGroup => These are not rendered on the mobile device but rather, control the way the View elements are laid out on the screen.
   3. For each View element we create a separate tag in our XML file. Each XML element has an attribute. 
   4. Each XML element can contain children. Children are other XML elements nested inside a particular element. 

3. We can reference **resources** in our XML files and our activity files. Resources can be strings, images etc.
