# Introduction to Generative AI

## What is Generative AI?

Till now the systems that we wrote were rule engines. Every output was defined based on some rule written in code. Generative AI is a paradigm shift in the sense that it can generate content of its own based on prompts.

### Defining AI

The concept of programming a computer to react to data in a way a intelligent being does.
For example, a cat on a screen is just a bunch of pixels for a computer whereas for an intelligent being we identify the features it has and then recognises that is indeed is a cat. The recognition of these features is what a machine learning problem is. In traditional programming the rules and the data are given to a program and an answer is returned. In Machine learning systems, the answer and the data is given and we need to figure out the rules.
